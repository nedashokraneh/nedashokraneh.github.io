I am a second year PhD student in Computer Science department at the Simon Fraser University, advised by 
<a href="https://sites.google.com/view/libbrecht-lab/home?authuser=0">Maxwell Libbrecht</a>. My research is in modeling biological data with probabilistic models and machine learning techniques. In particular, I am interested in clustering problems in relational biological data, probabilistic graphical models, and graph representation learning. Here is my <a href="http://nedashokraneh.github.io/files/CV.pdf">CV</a>.
